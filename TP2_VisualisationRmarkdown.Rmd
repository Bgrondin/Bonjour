## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages("DT")
library(DT)
datatable(mtcars, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX= T))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
message("Des Bisous")
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
